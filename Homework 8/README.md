Submission: Homework 8
Subject: ME 8710

The code explanation and the outputs generated has been 
put into the "Assignment8_ ME 8710_Output.pdf" file

Please follow the execution steps as mentioned in the file and
the degree of customization the code has been designed for, is also well established. 

Source Code files - 
Q1_SA.py - Simulated Annealing
Q2_PSO.py - Particle Swarm Optimization
Q3_GA.py - Genetic Algorithm 

Now, one more file is attached -  genetic.py is the user-defined module, which is one of the 
dependency which needs to be addressed for the genetic algorithm program to run
effectively. The steps for the same is also mentioned in the attached pdf file.

Thank you!
