Every Method in 8710 might not be used for solving the problem..
Program's / Commercial Algorithms can be used.

Program Written in - C++
-----------------------------------------------------------
Problem Objective:
- Determine the best configuration for a single rocket
Perform:
- - Place payloads into an orbit 
(Altitude(atleast): 400km) (1000 kg < mass < 15,000kg)
number of stages = n
Number of Engines = 
M = 

- - Orbital Acceleration balance must be POSITIVE at 
desired altitude

- - Maximum Dynamic Pressure no more than 
33% of Atmospheric Pressure (33,400 Pa)

- - Maximum Acceleration observed < 8g
